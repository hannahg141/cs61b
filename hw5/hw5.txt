HW #5.

Question D.

1. Omega: x^2, Oh: x^2, big theta: x^2


2. omega: log x, oh: log x, big theta: x


3. big oh: x^2, omega: x


4. theta(N + M)


5. theta(n log n)


6. also quite confused but M =< x < K
    if we convert the bases to the same values all are less than 10 anyway and are
    therefore smaller than base 10 when computed
    AND the constant K makes the right larger anyway because K < x.



7. log p(x) is in log x

    if p(x) = log(yx^2)
            = 2log(x) + log(y)
            = log(x) + log(y)
    there must be a constant y where log(x) > log(y)
    therefore true.


8. i genuinely don't understand this and I am very confused but I think that whatever
    f(n) returns it gets rounded up to its largest value and then it must be in the
    scope of that initial function
